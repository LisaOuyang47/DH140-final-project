# Topic 
This project about exploring Amazon Sales Dataset mainly focues on the ratings and reviews of Amazon product from kaggle.

Due to the rapid rise of the Internet, many business developments have mainly become very dependent on the Internet, and thus the E-commerce became dominant in consumption. As we all know, Amazon is the most influential multinational company selling online nowadays. Not only does it have a wide variety of products, regardless of region, but it also takes care of everything from export to return. 


But in any business, technology needs to humanize the business, in other words, we need the humanities to play a role in technology. Its main responsibility is not technical, but about human society, for instance, in marketing products, without caring about the real needs and emotions of users, but focusing on the competition of sales, the business will become less and less empathetic, and the leaders will be driven by economic interests only; in a word, business does not need humanities, but human beings do(Petriglieri, 2018).


This is the purpose of this project, to use coding to understand the real needs of the customer base, allowing Amazon to become more human by analyzing user data, in terms of product pricing and customer needs.

 
# Ideas/potential research questions 
 
For this project and the dataset, I will concenrate on three research questions: i)the popularity of product categories; ii) the relationship of discounted items to sales/ratings; iii) and the sentiment analysis of buyers towards the products.
